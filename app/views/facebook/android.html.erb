You have been invited to the world of WordSmash!
</div>

<div class="list">
WordSmash is the new Android crossword game that brings new life to head-to-head crossword fun:
</div>

<div class="list">
In a cool twist on tradition, letters can be played on top of previously played letters.  
This brings new strategies to bear as your game skills intensify.
</div>

<div class="list">
You can play games with UP TO 4 people!!  While you can certainly have the 1-on-1 experience of other crossword games, now you can 
play games with 2 or 3 opponents as well.  It's all up to you!
</div>

<div class="list">
Along with the normal list of letters you get in every game, 5 random letters are assigned per game (3 consonants and 2 vowels).
This means, for example, that spelling "pizza" (and having every letter count as part of the scoring) is a real possibility.  
And this means that determining which letters are left in the hopper is more challenging as well.
</div>

<div class="list">
In-game chat lets you taunt your opponents at will.  And you can always see a list of all of the words that were played in the game.
</div>

<div class="list">
As you win, level up with badges that show your opponents how lethal your WordSmash skills are.
</div>

<div class="list">
All of this and more is wrapped in a cool new user interface that gets you to the action quickly.  Come join the fun!
